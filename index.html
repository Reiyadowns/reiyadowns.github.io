    <p> Complex systems vs. Complicated systems. Complex systems are systems that consist of a multitude of agents, like bees in a beehive or water molecules in the ocean. These agents, each armed with simple rules or objectives of their own, like “collect pollen” or “form hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules”, act collectively within an environment to produce behavior that would be impossible to predict from the character of the agents or knowledge of their rules alone. [Show video of puppies from TED Talk: “puppies! Now that I have your attention, complex systems” here? It’s very enlightening] This differs, crucially, from complicated systems. Complicated systems may have a variety of different parts that interact with each other in different, simple ways, like the gears in a watch or cheerleaders in a pyramid. These systems don’t have emergent properties: you could surmise all that you need about the system from the parts and their interactions with each other. Further, complicated systems are easy to break. Remove a gear and the watch stops ticking. Remove a cheerleader and the tower comes tumbling down. Trap a bee in a jar and the beehive continues to run, barely affected. As a general rule, as complex systems grow more complex they grow more resilient. As systems with complexity increase their complexity, they become less resilient. </p>
